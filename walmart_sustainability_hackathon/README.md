# Walmart Sustainability Hackathon Project: GreenHorizon

## Project Vision

GreenHorizon is a comprehensive, AI-powered platform designed to help Walmart achieve its ambitious sustainability goals by tackling key challenges across its operations, from demand forecasting and waste reduction to ethical sourcing and carbon-neutral stores.

This prototype showcases core functionalities of the GreenHorizon platform, demonstrating its potential to:
*   Reduce waste and overstocking through precise demand prediction.
*   Minimize spoilage with real-time expiry tracking and dynamic pricing.
*   Enhance transparency and trust via an ethical sourcing platform.
*   Empower store managers with a centralized sustainability command center.

## Features Demonstrated (Conceptual Prototype)

This hackathon prototype will focus on demonstrating key aspects of the following integrated modules:

1.  **AI-Powered Demand Prediction:** Visualizing hyper-local forecasts and the impact of various factors.
2.  **Automated Expiry Tracking (GreenShelf):** Showing real-time shelf monitoring and predictive spoilage alerts.
3.  **Dynamic Pricing & Discounts:** Illustrating automated, intelligent markdowns for near-expiry items.
4.  **Ethical & Sustainable Sourcing Platform:** Presenting an interactive product traceability journey.
5.  **Centralized Operations Hub (Sustainability Command Center):** Displaying a dynamic dashboard of key sustainability metrics.

## Technology Stack (Hackathon Prototype)

*   **Backend:** Python (Flask)
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   **Data Visualization:** Chart.js (for charts), Leaflet.js (for maps - conceptual)
*   **Data Storage:** In-memory mock data / JSON files for the prototype.

## Setup and Running (Conceptual for Hackathon)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository (if applicable)
# git clone ...

# 2. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the Flask application
cd app
flask run  # Or python main.py if __main__ block is set up
```

Access the application via `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.
